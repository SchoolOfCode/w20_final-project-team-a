# Team Aztech - Showcasing work App
## School Of Code Cohort 6 final project

- **Our Problem**: Our Problem was to see how can we displau and promote the work that School of Code bootcampers put into the course

- **Solution**: We created essentially a gallery showcase where bootcampers can create an account and with this upload a project they have worked on which will then be displayed on the page. Bootcampers will be able to see their work displayed, upload a project and edit their profile. Admins are able to approve users work, set it as the chosen featured project and also remove work if needed.
