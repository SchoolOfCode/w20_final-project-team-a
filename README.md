# Team Aztech - SoC Expo
### Cohort 6 Final Project

#### Problem Statement  
Our Problem was to see how can we display and promote the work that School of Code bootcampers put into the course

####  Solution  
We created a showcase where: 
- School of Code bootcampers can create an account and upload information to display their projects
- School of Code admin can approve projects for display and select a project to feature on the landing page 
- External stakeholders can view all projects and bootcamper profiles

### User Flow

1. You will start on the homepage. Here you can see the featured project which has been chosen by the admins to highlight a specific project.

2. Clicking on the Showcase page will take you to a page that contains all of the uploaded projects. Users are then able to click on a projectwhich will then bring up more detailed information about that project, including further images.

3. Clicking on the Bootcampers page will then take you to a page that contains a list of all the bootcampers that have signed up. You are then able to click on a profile which will bring up the user's profile and information, as well as what projects they have been involved in.

4. Users can also log in if they have an account or if they don't they are then able to register their own account.

5. Once logged in, the user is able to edit their profile, including uploading an image, adding a breif statement and editing social media links. 

6. Upon logging in a new tab will appear in the navigation bar, which is the upload page, this is where the user is able to upload their own project.

7. If the user is an admin, they are able to access the admin page where they can to approve projects, set them as featured or remove them if needed.
