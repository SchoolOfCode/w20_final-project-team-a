# Team Aztech - Showcasing work App
## School Of Code Cohort 6 final project

- **Our Problem**: Our Problem was to see how can we displau and promote the work that School of Code bootcampers put into the course

- **Solution**: We created essentially a gallery showcase where bootcampers can create an account and with this upload a project they have worked on which will then be displayed on the page. Bootcampers will be able to see their work displayed, upload a project and edit their profile. Admins are able to approve users work, set it as the chosen featured project and also remove work if needed.

## How to use the app/ how the user navigates

1. Once the app is open you will be taken to the home/featured page. This page is where the featured project is displayed and this project is chosen by the admins as a highlight for a specific project

2. From here you are able to click on the "showcase" page, this will take you to a page that contains all of the uploaded projects. Users are then able to click on the projects which will take you to an enlarged version of the project that contains all of the information and images that the uploader provided

3. After here, users can then click on the "bootcampers" page, it will then take you to a page that contains a list of all the bootcampers that have signed up. You are then able to click on a profile and once clicked it will bring up the whole profile and information, as well as what projects they have been involved in.

4. Users then can log in if they have an account or if they don't they are then able to create their own account

5. Once logged in, the user is able to edit their profile, including uploading an image and editing links. 

6. Upon logging in a new tab will appear in the navigation bar, which is the upload page, this is where the user is able to upload their own project

7. If the user is an admin, they are able to access the admin page where they are able to approve projects, set them as featured and remove them if needed

8. There is then a feature to log out once you have finished.
